Weight :  20% 
 
A worksheet is provided with all Tables and Basic Layouts depicted in this document.  
 
Deliverables should be well documented, with joined files as pertinent ( software, spreadsheets, 
drawings, simulations, etc.), yet not forcing to rely on the joined files to evaluate the core of your 
deliverables.  
 
 
Overall Context and Mission  
FaMoaSa  is a parts manufacturing service provider specialized in implementing factories and 
warehouses dedicated to its clients and implemented near the assembly  plants of their clients , 
robustly delivering demanded products in swift in -time fashion . 
Up to now, FaMoaSa  has considered its implemented factories mostly as  job shops  and has thus 
always designed them according to a function organization.  
Recently, FaMo aSa leaders have been made aware that they may be restricting its manufacturing and 
logistic capability and service performance potential by (1) designing its factories only as function 
organizations, as there are numerous other organizational options that may be more appropriate in 
specific cases  and (2) factory organization has impact on its warehouses generally located adjacent 
to each specific client , notably their sizing and performance . 
FaMoaSa  has selected the factory and the warehouse it has implemented for two of its current clients 
A and B as a testbed for assessing the impact of alternative organizational designs.  This factory is 
built along a North -South highway with the product assembly factor ies of client s A and B respectively 
90 miles  to the North and 110 miles to the South . Currently FaMoaSa operates two warehouse s, 
respectively dedicated to  clients  A and B  and located on a  site adjacent to the client’s  factory.  
FaMoaSa  is requesting your help to perform  a rigorous assessment of the potentiality of leveraging 
alternative fac ility  organization designs , using the testbed as exemplar. The leadership wants your 
team to provide a fresh look, untainted by FaMoaSa  internal history and paradigms , so it will keep 
you at arm’s length while you perform the study.

Therefore , your team is hereafter provided with key functional and technical specifications for the 
testbed , yet not a single information about FaMoaSa’s  client s A & B, and about the factory  designed 
and implemented by  FaMoaSa ’s team three years ago to serve these  client s. 
Year +1  Demand Forecast and Performance Expectations from Client  
Located in the U.S.A., FaMoaSa ’s testbed factory produces parts for  the plant  of client A assembling 
products A1 to A3 and for the plant of client B that assembles products B1 and B2. The Year +1  
demand forecast provided by the two client s for their  products during the 12 -month period from 
January  1st to December 21st. First, they  provided the overall expected annual demand for each 
product. Second, as they both  recognize there is uncertainty on the overall quantity to be assembled 
for each product over Year +1 , they  provided the expected standard deviation of to -be-realized Year 
+1 demand around the provided forecast for each product.  
 
 
 
 
Third, as neither of them  foresee any seasonal pattern in its assembly factory demand, they  provided 
the expected average weekly demand forecast for each of their  products over Year +1 , which is simply 
the annual demand forecast divided by 52. Fourth, as they  know there are to be actual fluctuation of 
assembly production around this weekly average expectation, they both  provide d the expected Year 
+1 coefficient of variation of weekly demand  for each product.  Fifth, as their  daily assembly schedules 
within a week are  highly smoothed , the two client s specified that the weekly demand is smoothed 
over the five days a week  in two shifts of 8 hours a day . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FaMoaSa ’s client s A and B assemble  their  products , respectively A1 to A3  for A  and B1  and B2  for B, 
from 20 parts  provided by FaMoaSa ’s parts factory. Here is the Product -Parts matrix  for these 
products .

Clients A and B respectively keep a buffer of each FaMoaSa’s parts offering a 99% autonomy of four 
and 12 hours respectively. The client s request that their  assembly plant  be replenished continuously 
from FaMoaSa ’s parts factory  during operating shifts , once an hour for client A  and once every four 
hours for client B , with on-time in -full (OTIF) replenishment service level of 99.5% . subject to 
financial penalties for exceeding 0.5% of late replenishments  and for stopping assembly of any of the 
client’s products . So, the parts factory must  be designed to robustly meet this service level agreement.  
Testbed Factory Specifications  
FaMoaSa ’s parts  factory is to be operating according to one or two 8-hour/day shifts over 5 days a 
week  while warehousing is to operate two 8 -hour/day shifts over 5 days a week  as the clients do .  
FaMoaSa  knows that it can leverage overtime and extra shifts to compensate for major disruptions, 
yet it wants to make sure the factory is designed not to need extra working hours and days through 
its normal operation.  
Hereafter are listed the parts manufactured by FaMoaSa  with their X, Y and Z (height) dimensions, 
their weight and their materials cost.

Materials for each part are to be brought from FaMoaSa ’s Materials Supply  Center (MSC) to the parts 
factory in 100 -part kits whose total weight and volume is 150% of the sum of the individual part 
weight and volume. As several other factories of FaMoaSa, t he testbed factory is inbound fed once a 
week for each part  from the MSC located 250 miles away . The factory is aiming to maintain a 99.9% 
robust two -week materials inventory.  
 
Making the parts portfolio requires FaMoaSa  to be equipped to realize  13 processes  A to M. The 
following Table provides the manufacturing process for each part, expressing at each step the type 
of operation s to be performed. The part materials kit is brought as input to the first step of its 
manufacturing process  and follows the parts through the process .

At each process step for each part, the following Table provides the process time in minutes  per unit 
for performing the required operation. FaMoaSa  requires you to assume 90% efficiency and 9 8% 
reliability of all equipment, with 100% quality  at each operation .  
 
 
Each of these process operations requires specialized equipment that must  be staffed by expert 
operators. The following Table provides a portfolio of equipment available on the market. Each is 
identified by a letter code expressing which process operations it can perform . For example, CD 
equipment can perform  operations C and/or D on any part.  The Table  below provides  for each 
equipment type its installed price as well as the expected cost induced every time a unit of this 
equipment is to be later relocated within the factory. It also provides the expected equipment useful 
life, at which time the equipment would be discarded with negligible residual value.

Each equipment type requires a distinct staffing level. FaMoaSa  has three types of operators, termed 
C1, C2 and C3. The Table above provides the number of operators of each type required for each 
implemented equipment unit in a specific center. For example , equipment A requires the full -time 
presence of one C1 operator and one fourth of a C2 operator. Fractions of an operator may be shared 
within a center, but not between centers, except for small adjacent centers such in a holographic 
factory.  Based on exp erience, w orker s are expected to work 49 weeks out of the 52 each year , 
accounting for holiday , sick days,  and vacations . The following Table provides the hourly cost of each 
type of operator, including salary, benefits, and support.  
 
Operator  Hourly Cost  
C1  $40  
C2  $75  
C3  $100  
Hereafter  are provided layout schematics for each category of equipment: A -B-C-D, E -F-G, H -I-J and 
K-L-M. Each one depicts the shape of the equipment unit itself, the typical position of an operator, 
zone -s for inbound materials or parts and outbound work -in-proces s or completed parts, and zone 
to be left open for maintenance purposes. These layouts are indicative and may be improved upon as 
desired.

Full lines are meant to state rigid boundaries not to be shared with other equipment units while 
dotted lines express areas sharable with adjacent equipment unit when pertinent. It is possible to 
alter these schematics as long as the proposed alterations are plausible.  
All handling within the above zones, from inbound to outbound, is performed by the assigned 
operators. All handling of material kits and parts between centers and non -adjacent equipment zones 
is performed by handlers, costing 40 $/hour as the C1 operators. You are responsible for suggesting 
handling/storage units and means (vehicles, racking, etc.) and get documented rough -cut pricing for 
these.  
Assume that the factory building implementation costs are 250 $/ft 2, the equipment is to have 
negligible residual value at the end of its useful life, and FaMoaSa  uses a 10% rate for its financial 
expenses, including inventory.  
 
Task 1  
Leveraging the client’s information on demand forecast and service performance expectation s, develop 
a demand fulfillment capacity plan  for each part  in the overall FaMoaSa  factory over  the Year +1  
horizon .

Task 2  
Develop an  overall finished storage capacity plan for each part  for the Year +1 horizon , then propose  
how much storage of each part should be kept as outbound storage in the factory and how much 
should be kept in each of the two warehouses near clients A and B respectively, to ensure service 
level agreement is robustly respected.  
Note that there is no obligation for you to use the three locations for parts storage .  
Assume that parts are stored in standard rackin g without reliance on automated storage and 
handling equipment. Also assume that the near -client storage building s, if used, have an internal 
usable height of 20 feet and are costing 200$  per square feet .  
Task 3 
Consider  the following eight alternative parts factories  to satisfy the client’s demand over the Year +1  
planning horizon : 
a. Function  organization : A factory organized as a network of elementary -process -dedicated 
centers with a single center per process , including  centers dedicated to  receiving, inbound 
storage, outbound storage, and shipping processes . 
b. Process organization : A factory organized as a network of composite -process -dedicated 
centers with a single instance of each cente r, including centers dedicated to  receiving, inbound 
storage, outbound storage, and shipping processes . 
c. Parts organization : A factory organized as a network of part -dedicated centers  with a single 
center per part . You are allowed  to include the  receiving, storage, and shipping processes are 
included in each  part center  or to propose some other  organization for these processes . 
d. Group organization : A factory organized as a network of parts -group -dedicated production 
centers  with each part assigned to a single group center . You are allowed to include the 
receiving, , inbound and outbound storage, and shipping processes are included in each group 
center or to propose some other organization for these processes.  
e. Product  organization : A factory organized as a network of product dedicated production 
centers , each  making all parts required for its dedicated client product . You are allowed to 
include the receiving, inbound and outbound storage, and shipping processes are included in 
each product center or to propose some other organization for these processes.  
f. Fractal organization : A factory organized as a network of  f fractal centers capable of making  
all products, with approximately 1/f of the overall demand satisfaction capacity required from 
the factory.  You are allowed to include the receiving,  inbound and outbound storage, and 
shipping processes are included in each product center or to propose some other organization 
for these processes.  
g. Holographic organization : A factory organized a s a network of small, focused  process centers  
(elementary or composite processes), most of these centers having several instances distributed 
throughout the factory , jointly capable of making all products at the required capacity.  
h. Free -style organization : Learning from a to g, a factory organized as a network combining as 
you best prefer any of the types of center  types used in a to g, or any other type using the 
framework introduced in class. This one is expected to be according to your assessment your 
best performing design, or at least be among the top three contenders.

Select five factory organization types for which you will realize a factory design , respecting  the following 
constraints : 
• Function organization -based factory  (a) is mandatory  
• At least one  between the fractal and holographic factories  (f, g)  
• Free -style organization -based factory (h) is mandatory  
Justify your selection.  
 
For each of the five facility design s, provide the following:  
1. Its network organization, including a network diagram and the mission of each center  in the 
factory and used near -client warehouse -s 
2. Center -specific and overall resource requirements plan in terms of equipment and personnel  for 
production, storage, and material handling  
3. Layout of each center and of the overall factory  and the near -client  warehouse -s (if used)  
4. Estimated intra -center work and flow patterns and utilization profile in each center, clearly 
outlining how you proceeded, providing your results through both Table and Schematic formats  
overlaid on the layout  
5. Estimated inter -center flows and travel distances and traffic, with graphical flow diagrams, 
heatmaps, and tabular results  
6. Expected key factory and warehouse performance indicators  
7. Overall expected investment and direct operating costs , including those induced by production, 
storage, and material handling  
 
Systematically contrast and rank your  generated alternative fac ility designs, then discuss your results, 
with emphasis on key insights to FaMoaSa  and on your key learning.  
 
 
Year +2 to +5  Demand Forecast and Performance Expectations from Client  
 
During the planning horizon  spanning years +2 to +5 , FaMoaSa ’s testbed factory will have to extend 
its capacity to make parts for one new product A 4 of client A and for two new products B3 and B4 of 
client B .  
The demand forecast for years +2 to +5 provided by the client s for feeding assembly of their  products 
is as follows. First, the clients  provided the overall expected demand for each product. Second, as t hey 
both  recognize there is still uncertainty on the overall quantity to be assembled for each product from 
to Year +2  to Year +5 , they  provided the expected standard deviation of to -be-realized Year +2 to +5  
demand around the provided forecast for each product.

Third, as they  still do not foresee any seasonal pattern in their  assembly factory demand, they  
provided the expected average weekly demand forecast for each of their  products over Year +2 to +5  
as done for Year +1 . Fourth, as they  know there are to be actual fluctuation of assembly production 
around this weekly average expectation, they  provide d the expected Year +2 to +5  coefficient of 
variation of weekly demand for each product. Fifth, as their  daily assembly schedules within a week 
are highly smoothed, the client s specified that the weekly demand will keep being smoothed over the 
five days a week, one or two shifts a day, and 8 hours a shift operation.

FaMoaSa ’s clients assemble  the new three products using the same 20 parts  provided by FaMoaSa’s 
parts factory as in Year +1. The Table above  is the Product -Parts matrix  for these products . 
The client s request the same service performance in Year +2 to +5  as in Year +1 .  So, the parts factory 
and the warehouse -s must be designed to robustly meet the same service level agreement.  
 
Task 4 
 
Consider  the following facility designs  realized in task 2:  
i. Function -organization -based factory design from task 2.a  
ii. Top-ranked factory design among those produced in tasks 2.b to 2.g  
iii. Free-style factory design  from task 2.h  
a. For each of these three designs, develop a proposal for evolving the organization (while respecting 
its type ), the set of equipment and the pool of personnel, as well as the layout, to be ready as best 
as possible  at the beginning of each year  to satisfy the demand for that year.  Specifically, you have 
to provide : 
1. Its network organization  planned in each , including a network diagram and the mission of 
each center , providing clear depiction of its evolution (when pertinent)  
2. Yearly c enter -specific and overall resource requirements plan in terms of equipment and 
personnel for production, storage, and material handling  
3. Yearly l ayout of each center and of the overall factory  and warehouse -s 
4. Yearly relayout p lan identifying all changes to be made in the factory  and warehouse -s to 
accommodate changing demand  and the evolving  sets of center s, equipment , and personnel ; 
coupled with vivid graphical depiction of  all relayout efforts  
5. For each year, e stimated intra -center work and flow patterns and utilization profile in each 
center, providing your results through both Table and Schematic formats overlaid on layout  
6. For each year, e stimated inter -center flows and travel distances and traffic, with graphical 
flow diagrams, heatmaps, and tabular results  
7. For each year and overall, e xpected key factory  and warehouse  performance indicators  
8. Yearly and o verall expected investment and direct operating costs, including those induced 
by production, storage, and material handling  
b. Systematically contrast and rank your generated alternative factory designs, then discuss your 
results,  
Task 5 
Provide FaMoaSa  an Executive Summary highlighting your overall assessments, insights, and 
recommendations, in a two -page -max  format including compelling Figures and/or Tables.  
Task 6 
Synthesize your team’s key learnings from performing this casework.  
 
I hope this casework proves to be a challenging, stimulating, and worthwhile learning experience.
