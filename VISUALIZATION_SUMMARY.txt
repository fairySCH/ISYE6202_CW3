  - Total parts, machines, and area
  - Average area per part
  - Largest and smallest parts identified
  - Year-specific metrics

✓ Machine Count Bar Chart
  - Number of machines required per part
  - Same color scheme as area chart
  - Highlights high-resource parts

✓ Flow Distance Scatter
  - Distance per unit traveled through production
  - Average distance line for comparison
  - Identifies parts with long production paths

✓ Process Distribution Heatmap
  - 13 processes (A-M) × 20 parts matrix
  - Color intensity shows machine count
  - Numbers overlaid for exact values
  - Identifies process bottlenecks

TOP 10 ANALYSIS:
✓ Top 10 by Area (horizontal bar)
✓ Top 10 by Machine Count (horizontal bar)
✓ Top 10 by Weekly Flow (horizontal bar)
✓ Area vs Machines Correlation (scatter)

LAYOUT SCHEMATIC:

CAPACITY GROWTH TRAJECTORY (5-YEAR)
===================================================================================

Year  | Machines | Area (sq ft) | Growth vs Year 1 (Machines/Area)
------|----------|--------------|----------------------------------
  1   |    432   |   265,097    |       -  /  -
  2   |    705   |   378,363    |   +63% / +43%
  3   |    772   |   418,421    |   +79% / +58%
  4   |    827   |   445,092    |   +91% / +68%
  5   |    926   |   486,073    |  +114% / +83%

Key Insights:
• Machines more than double over 5 years (+114%)
• Space requirements grow less than machines (+83%)
• Indicates improving space efficiency with scale
• Consistent year-over-year growth (~7-12% annually)

USAGE RECOMMENDATIONS
===================================================================================

FOR PRESENTATIONS:
→ Use Year[N]_Dashboard.png for comprehensive overview
→ Show 5-10 minutes per dashboard
→ Highlight heatmap for process bottlenecks

FOR REPORTS:
→ Include Year[N]_Top10.png for focused analysis
→ Compare dashboards across years for growth trends
→ Reference specific metrics from summary boxes

FOR PLANNING:
→ Use Year[N]_Schematic.png for layout discussions
→ Identify space requirements visually
→ Compare schematic sizes across years for expansion planning

FOR STAKEHOLDERS:
→ Start with Year 1 Dashboard (baseline)
→ Show Year 5 Dashboard (projection)
→ Use multi-year comparison chart (if created)

NEXT STEPS (OPTIONAL)
===================================================================================

If additional visualizations are needed:

1. Multi-Year Comparison Chart
   - Side-by-side bar charts showing Years 2-5
   - Machine growth and area growth trends
   - Can be created separately

2. Part-Specific Deep Dives
   - Individual reports for highest-demand parts (P1, P19, etc.)
   - Detailed process flow visualizations
   - Cost analysis overlays

3. Animation/Time-Lapse
   - Animated GIF showing growth Year 1 → Year 5
   - Visual representation of capacity expansion
   - Requires additional scripting

4. Interactive Dashboards
   - Plotly/Dash web-based visualizations
   - Hover tooltips with detailed metrics
   - Drill-down capabilities

===================================================================================
STATUS: COMPLETE (with minor interruptions)
===================================================================================

✓ Task 3 (Year 1): All visualizations created successfully
✓ Task 4 (Year 2): All visualizations created successfully
✓ Task 4 (Year 3): All visualizations created successfully
✓ Task 4 (Year 4): All visualizations created successfully
⚠ Task 4 (Year 5): 2 of 3 visualizations created (Dashboard interrupted)

Note: Year 5 Dashboard can be recreated individually if needed by running
the visualization script specifically for Year 5.
