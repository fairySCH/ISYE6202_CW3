ANALYSIS OVERVIEW:
The functional layout analysis evaluates organizing production by process type,
grouping similar operations together to maximize efficiency and minimize material handling.

KEY FINDINGS:

• Active Processes: 13/13 total processes utilized
• Total Equipment Required (2 shifts): 386 units
• Total Weekly Workload: 26,657.1 hours
• Average Equipment Utilization: 96.0%

• High Utilization Processes (>80%): 13 processes
• Low Utilization Processes (<60%): 0 processes


EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS BY PROCESS (2-Shift Operation):

FUNCTIONAL LAYOUT ADVANTAGES:
------------------------------
• Specialized equipment grouping improves process efficiency
• Easier supervision and quality control per process type
• Simplified maintenance and equipment management
• Better skill specialization for operators
• Reduced setup times for similar operations

FUNCTIONAL LAYOUT CHALLENGES:
------------------------------
• Higher material handling requirements between processes
• Work-in-progress inventory accumulation
• Complex material flow patterns
• Potential bottlenecks at high-volume processes
• Longer production lead times

RECOMMENDATIONS:
---------------
1. Focus on balancing process capacities to avoid bottlenecks
2. Optimize material handling systems between functional areas
3. Implement pull systems to reduce work-in-progress
4. Consider hybrid layouts for high-volume product families
5. Regular monitoring of process utilization and flow efficiency
