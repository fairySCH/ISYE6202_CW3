4. EQUIPMENT GROUP UTILIZATION:
   
   Group ABCD (14×14 ft, 2 ft overlap):
   - Used by: P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7
   - Process B most common: appears in 5 parts (7 areas total)
   
   Group EFG (22×15 ft, no overlap):
   - Used by: P7-P16 (10 parts)
   - Process E most common: appears in 9 parts (12 areas total)
   
   Group HIJ (14×36 ft, no overlap):
   - Used by: P1-P16 (16 parts)
   - Process J most common: appears in 11 parts
   - Largest equipment drives significant footprint
   
   Group KLM (3×6 ft, 1 ft overlap):
   - Used by: P17, P18, P19, P20 (4 parts only)
   - Most space-efficient equipment
   - Process M appears in all 4 parts

5. SPACE EFFICIENCY COMPARISON:
   
   Area per Machine:
   - P1: 48,384 sq ft ÷ 68 machines = 711.5 sq ft/machine
   - P16: 30,672 sq ft ÷ 31 machines = 989.4 sq ft/machine
   - P17: 273 sq ft ÷ 10 machines = 27.3 sq ft/machine
   - P19: 806 sq ft ÷ 51 machines = 15.8 sq ft/machine
   
   Insight: KLM parts achieve 45-60x better space efficiency per machine

6. FLOW EFFICIENCY COMPARISON:
   
   Flow per Unit Produced:
   - High flow: P1 (229.91 ft), P16 (193.34 ft) - large equipment
   - Low flow: P17 (11.99 ft), P20 (11.79 ft) - compact equipment
   
   Total Weekly Flow Impact:
   - P1: 4.8 million unit-ft/week (highest despite fewer steps)
   - P14: 2.4 million unit-ft/week (high demand + moderate distance)
   - P17: 60k unit-ft/week (low demand + short distance)

VALIDATION:
-----------
✓ Total machines = 432 (matches corrected capacity plan)
✓ All process sequences verified against Parts_Step_Time.csv
✓ Equipment dimensions verified against Block_Specs.csv
✓ Overlap calculations correct per group specifications
✓ Flow distances calculated center-to-center with Euclidean distance
✓ Duplicate processes counted correctly (B twice in P1, etc.)

METHODOLOGY:
------------
- Layout Strategy: Compact vertical stacking, GAP=0
- Grid Optimization: Prefer taller grids (more rows) for space efficiency
- Equipment Specs: Block_Specs.csv (authoritative source)
  * ABCD: 14×14 ft, 2 ft overlap (3 sides)
  * EFG: 22×15 ft, 0 ft overlap
  * HIJ: 14×36 ft, 0 ft overlap
  * KLM: 3×6 ft, 1 ft overlap (2 sides)
- Flow Calculation: Center-to-center Euclidean distance
- Total Flow Formula: Weekly_Demand × Distance_Per_Unit

STRATEGIC INSIGHTS:
-------------------

1. Equipment Mix Impact:
   Parts using HIJ equipment (H, I, J) require significantly more space
   due to 14×36 ft footprint per unit. P1, P7, P16 consume 40% of total
   area despite representing only 15% of parts.

2. KLM Advantage:
   Parts P17-P20 using only KLM equipment are extremely space-efficient.
   Total KLM area = 1,937 sq ft (0.7% of total) for 103 machines (24%).

3. Process Complexity:
   7-step parts (P1, P6, P13) require more complex layouts but don't
   necessarily have longest flow distances if equipment is compact.

4. Demand-Flow Relationship:
   High demand parts with long flow distances (P1, P7, P14, P16) are
   primary targets for layout optimization and material handling automation.

5. Facility Planning:
   Total 265,097 sq ft assumes each part has dedicated area. In practice,
   some processes could be shared (e.g., common B area for P1-P5) to
   reduce total footprint, but would increase flow complexity.
