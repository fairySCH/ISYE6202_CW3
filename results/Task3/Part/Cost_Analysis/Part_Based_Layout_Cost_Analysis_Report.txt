Average equipment useful life: 10.7 years

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
----------------------------
• Total Equipment Units Required: 432
• Total Annual Production Hours: 2,772,333
• Average Equipment Utilization: 84.4%
• Capital Cost per Equipment Unit: $397,606
• Operating Cost per Hour: $18.86
• Total Cost per Hour: $23.39

COST EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS
--------------------------

• Cost Efficiency Ratio: $27.72 per hour per utilization percentage point
• Labor Cost as % of Total Annual Cost: 80.6%
• Depreciation as % of Total Annual Cost: 19.4%

BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS
--------------------
Assuming 5-year payback period for capital investment:
• Annual Capital Recovery: $34,353,200
• Total Annual Cost (including capital recovery): $99,211,483
• Break-even Hourly Rate Required: $35.79/hour

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. Focus on high-utilization processes (M, J, D, I, H) for maximum ROI
2. Consider preventive maintenance to extend equipment life and reduce depreciation costs
3. Optimize operator scheduling to maximize utilization during peak hours
4. Evaluate automation opportunities for high-volume processes to reduce labor costs
5. Monitor cost per hour metrics regularly to identify efficiency improvements
