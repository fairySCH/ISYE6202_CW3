KEY INSIGHTS FROM CORRECTED ANALYSIS:
================================================================================

HIGHEST CAPITAL COSTS:
  1. Process H: $41,800,000 (38 units @ $1,100,000 each)
  2. Process J: $36,600,000 (61 units @ $600,000 each)
  3. Process I: $22,800,000 (38 units @ $600,000 each)

HIGHEST OPERATING COSTS:
  1. Process J: $10,150,400/year (122.0 operators)
  2. Process B: $8,112,000/year (48.8 operators)
  3. Process I: $6,323,200/year (76.0 operators)
  4. Process H: $6,323,200/year (76.0 operators)

COST PER OPERATING HOUR:
  - $18.86 per hour (corrected)
  - Based on 4,160 operating hours/year (2 shifts)

UTILIZATION BY PROCESS (With Reliability Factor):
  - Process M: 97.0% (highest)
  - Process D: 95.1%
  - Process L: 93.2%
  - Process J: 90.2%
  - Process B: 91.4%
  - Process G: 61.0% (lowest - potential for optimization)

================================================================================
ACCURACY IMPROVEMENTS:
================================================================================

The corrected analysis now properly accounts for:
  ✅ 90% Equipment efficiency
  ✅ 98% Equipment reliability
  ✅ 99% Target utilization
  ✅ 88.2% Effective availability (0.90 × 0.98 × 0.99)

This results in:
  ✅ Realistic capacity per machine: 4,191.3 min/week
  ✅ Accurate machine requirements per process
  ✅ Realistic utilization rates (84.4% average vs 96.2%)
  ✅ Proper cost projections for budgeting

================================================================================
FINANCIAL IMPACT SUMMARY:
================================================================================

Total Investment Increase: $21.1M (+14%)
Annual Cost Increase: $6.2M (+13.4%)
10-Year NPV Impact: ~$62M (at 5% discount rate)

RECOMMENDATION:
The corrected analysis provides realistic cost projections for:
  - Budget planning
  - Investment approval
  - Resource allocation
  - ROI calculations

Previous analysis significantly UNDERSTATED required investment and
operating costs by not accounting for equipment reliability factor.
