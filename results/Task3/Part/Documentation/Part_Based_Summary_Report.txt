TASK 3: PARTS-BASED DESIGN - CAPACITY ANALYSIS SUMMARY
================================================================================

KEY FINDINGS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   • 1-Shift Operation: 986.0 total equipment units
   • 2-Shift Operation: 518.0 total equipment units
   • Savings with 2-shift: 468.0 units (47.5% reduction)

2. BOTTLENECK PROCESSES (Top 5 by Equipment Count):
   • Process M: 87 units
   • Process B: 63 units
   • Process J: 61 units
   • Process L: 57 units
   • Process D: 53 units

3. HIGHEST DEMAND PARTS (Top 5):
   • P1: 20,962 units/week
   • P19: 20,000 units/week
   • P14: 18,077 units/week
   • P20: 14,808 units/week
   • P7: 13,846 units/week

4. PROCESS FREQUENCY:
   • Total operations per week: 1,510,000
   • Most frequent processes:
     - Process I: 185,385 ops/week (12.3%)
     - Process G: 166,923 ops/week (11.1%)
     - Process D: 144,615 ops/week (9.6%)

5. MATERIAL FLOW ANALYSIS:
   • Total weekly flow volume: 755,000 units
   • Highest flow process pairs:
     - I → J: 80,385 units/week
     - C → D: 56,923 units/week
     - L → M: 45,000 units/week

STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS:
================================================================================

1. OPERATION STRATEGY:
   - Recommend 2-SHIFT operation to minimize equipment investment
   - Reduces equipment count by 468.0 units

2. CAPACITY PLANNING:
   - Focus on bottleneck processes: M, B, J, L, D
   - Consider equipment flexibility (multi-process machines)
   - Plan for maintenance windows given high utilization

3. MATERIAL FLOW OPTIMIZATION:
   - Analyze process adjacency based on flow matrices
   - Minimize transport between high-flow process pairs
   - Consider cellular manufacturing layout

4. PARTS-BASED DESIGN IMPLICATIONS:
   - Each of 20 parts would have dedicated production cell
   - Cells contain all processes needed for that part
   - Simplifies material flow and reduces WIP
   - May duplicate equipment across cells (consider Group Tech)

5. POTENTIAL PROCESS GROUPINGS (for optimization):
   • A-B-C-D group: High interaction in many parts
   • E-F-G group: Similar equipment requirements
   • H-I-J group: Heavy finishing operations
   • K-L-M group: Lightweight operations
