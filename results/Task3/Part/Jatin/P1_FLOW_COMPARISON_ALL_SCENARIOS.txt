  TOTAL:     = 12.75 min/unit

Transitions (6 movements):
  1. B → A
  2. A → B
  3. B → C
  4. C → D
  5. D → I
  6. I → J

================================================================================
SCENARIO 1: TASK 3 YEAR +1 (ALL 20 PARTS)
================================================================================

Context: Part 1 is one of 20 parts processed in this facility

P1 Demand: 20,961.54 units/week
Total Facility: 344 machines across 13 processes (A-M)

MACHINE ALLOCATION FOR P1:
  Process B: Uses 32 machines (handles P1 + other parts)
  Process A: Uses 10 machines (handles P1 + other parts)
  Process C: Uses  9 machines (handles P1 + other parts)
  Process D: Uses 45 machines (handles P1 + other parts)
  Process I: Uses 28 machines (handles P1 + other parts)
  Process J: Uses 49 machines (handles P1 + other parts)

P1 WORKLOAD (minutes/week):
  B: 20,961.54 × 2.5 = 52,403.85 min (Step 1)
  A: 20,961.54 × 1.0 = 20,961.54 min
  B: 20,961.54 × 2.5 = 52,403.85 min (Step 3)
  C: 20,961.54 × 0.5 = 10,480.77 min
  D: 20,961.54 × 2.5 = 52,403.85 min
  I: 20,961.54 × 1.25 = 26,201.92 min
  J: 20,961.54 × 2.5 = 52,403.85 min
  TOTAL: 267,259.62 min/week for P1

LAYOUT CHARACTERISTICS:
  Facility: 1,006 ft × 252 ft = 253,512 sq ft
  Process arrangement: A→B→C→D→E→F→G→H→I→J→K→L→M (linear)
  
  Process Positions (center coordinates):
    B: (56, 126)
    A: (13, 126)
    C: (105, 126)
    D: (160, 126)
    I: (573, 126)
    J: (676, 126)

FLOW DISTANCES (Rectilinear):
  B → A: |13-56| + |126-126| = 43 ft
  A → B: |56-13| + |126-126| = 43 ft
  B → C: |105-56| + |126-126| = 49 ft
  C → D: |160-105| + |126-126| = 55 ft
  D → I: |573-160| + |126-126| = 413 ft ← LONGEST
  I → J: |676-573| + |126-126| = 103 ft
  TOTAL: 706 ft per unit

Average Distance: 706 / 6 = 117.67 ft per transition

KEY INSIGHT:
  In the all-parts layout, P1 shares machines with 19 other parts.
  The D→I transition is very long (413 ft) because E, F, G, H processes
  are between D and I (needed for other parts, not P1).

================================================================================
SCENARIO 2: TASK 4 YEAR 2 (PART 1 ONLY)
================================================================================

Context: Entire facility dedicated to Part 1 production only

P1 Demand: 26,100 units/week (24.5% higher than Task 3)
Total Facility: 72 machines across 7 processes (only P1 processes)

MACHINE ALLOCATION (P1 ONLY):
  Process B1: 14 machines (first B operation)
  Process A:   6 machines
  Process B2: 14 machines (second B operation)
  Process C:   3 machines
  Process D:  14 machines
  Process I:   7 machines
  Process J:  14 machines
  TOTAL: 72 machines

Note: B process is split into B1 and B2 since P1 visits B twice

LAYOUT CHARACTERISTICS:
  Facility: 298 ft × 108 ft = 32,184 sq ft (7.9× smaller than Task 3)
  Process arrangement: B1→A→B2→C→D→I→J (sequential, no gaps)
  
  Process Positions (center coordinates):
    B1: (19, 54)
    A:  (45, 54)
    B2: (71, 54)
    C:  (90, 54)
    D: (116, 54)
    I: (173, 54)
    J: (230, 54)

FLOW DISTANCES (Rectilinear):
  B1 → A:  |45-19| + |54-54| = 26 ft
  A → B2:  |71-45| + |54-54| = 26 ft
  B2 → C:  |90-71| + |54-54| = 19 ft
  C → D:  |116-90| + |54-54| = 26 ft
  D → I:  |173-116| + |54-54| = 57 ft
  I → J:  |230-173| + |54-54| = 57 ft
  TOTAL: 211 ft per unit

Average Distance: 211 / 6 = 35.17 ft per transition

KEY INSIGHT:
  Dedicated P1 layout is much more compact. All processes arranged
  sequentially with no unnecessary gaps. Distance is 3.3× shorter
  per unit compared to Task 3.

================================================================================
SCENARIO 3: TASK 4 YEAR 3 (PART 1 ONLY)
================================================================================

Context: Same layout as Year 2, but increased demand

P1 Demand: 27,300 units/week (4.6% higher than Year 2)
Total Facility: 76 machines across 7 processes

MACHINE ALLOCATION (P1 ONLY):
  Process B1: 14 machines ⚠️ BOTTLENECK (101.6% utilization)
  Process A:   6 machines
  Process B2: 15 machines (increased from Year 2)
  Process C:   3 machines
  Process D:  15 machines (increased from Year 2)
  Process I:   8 machines (increased from Year 2)
  Process J:  15 machines (increased from Year 2)
  TOTAL: 76 machines (+4 from Year 2)

LAYOUT CHARACTERISTICS:
  Facility: 298 ft × 108 ft = 32,184 sq ft (same as Year 2)
  Process arrangement: B1→A→B2→C→D→I→J (identical to Year 2)
  
  Process Positions: IDENTICAL TO YEAR 2

FLOW DISTANCES (Rectilinear):
  IDENTICAL TO YEAR 2: 211 ft total, 35.17 ft average

KEY INSIGHT:
  Year 3 identifies a bottleneck at B1 (101.6% utilization).
  The layout remains the same, but capacity is insufficient at B1.
  This drives the need for additional capacity in Year 4.

================================================================================
SCENARIO 4: TASK 4 YEAR 4 (PART 1 ONLY)
================================================================================

Context: Same layout, bottleneck resolved

P1 Demand: 28,500 units/week (4.4% higher than Year 3)
Total Facility: 77 machines across 7 processes

MACHINE ALLOCATION (P1 ONLY):
  Process B1: 15 machines (increased from 14) ✓ Bottleneck resolved
  Process A:   6 machines
  Process B2: 15 machines
  Process C:   3 machines
  Process D:  15 machines
  Process I:   8 machines
  Process J:  15 machines
  TOTAL: 77 machines (+1 from Year 3)

LAYOUT CHARACTERISTICS:
  Facility: 298 ft × 108 ft = 32,184 sq ft (same as Year 2 & 3)
  Process arrangement: B1→A→B2→C→D→I→J (identical to Year 2 & 3)
  
  Process Positions: IDENTICAL TO YEAR 2 & 3

FLOW DISTANCES (Rectilinear):
  IDENTICAL TO YEAR 2 & 3: 211 ft total, 35.17 ft average

KEY INSIGHT:
  Year 4 resolves the B1 bottleneck by adding 1 machine.
  Layout remains unchanged - stable design across years 2-4.
  All processes now operate efficiently (92.8% - 99.0% utilization).

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. LAYOUT EFFICIENCY:
   - Dedicated P1 layouts (Years 2-4) are 7.9× smaller than Task 3
   - Task 3 must accommodate all 20 parts, creating large footprint
   - Years 2-4 optimize specifically for P1's process sequence

2. FLOW DISTANCES:
   - Task 3: 706 ft total per unit (117.67 ft avg per transition)
   - Years 2-4: 211 ft total per unit (35.17 ft avg per transition)
   - Dedicated layout reduces distance by 70% (3.3× improvement)
   
3. LONGEST TRANSITIONS:
   - Task 3: D→I (413 ft) due to EFGH processes in between
   - Years 2-4: D→I and I→J (both 57 ft) - no wasted gaps

4. DEMAND GROWTH:
   - Task 3: 20,962 units/week (baseline)
   - Year 2: 26,100 units/week (+24.5%)
   - Year 3: 27,300 units/week (+30.2%)
   - Year 4: 28,500 units/week (+35.9%)

5. MACHINE EFFICIENCY:
   - Task 3: 344 machines handle 20 parts (197,500 units/week total)
   - Years 2-4: 72-77 machines handle only P1 (26,100-28,500 units/week)
   - Per-machine productivity similar (~574 units/machine/week)

6. CAPACITY PLANNING:
   - Task 3: Shares capacity across all parts (flexible but inefficient)
   - Year 2: Adequate capacity for 26,100 units/week
   - Year 3: Bottleneck at B1 (101.6% utilization)
   - Year 4: Bottleneck resolved (+1 machine to B1)

7. LAYOUT STABILITY:
   - Task 3: One-time design for all parts
   - Years 2-4: Same layout across 3 years (stable)
   - Only machine counts change, not layout dimensions

8. COST IMPLICATIONS:
   - Task 3: $70M total ($35M attributable to P1, assuming 50% share)
   - Years 2-4: $12.66M - $13.55M (dedicated to P1)
   - Dedicated layout is 2.6× more cost-efficient for P1

================================================================================
STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

IF PRODUCING ONLY P1:
  ✓ Use dedicated layout (Years 2-4 approach)
  ✓ Smaller facility (32k sq ft vs 253k sq ft)
  ✓ Shorter distances (211 ft vs 706 ft per unit)
  ✓ Lower investment ($13.55M vs ~$35M for P1 share)
  ✓ Higher efficiency (98.3% vs 96.9%)

IF PRODUCING ALL 20 PARTS:
  ✓ Use mixed layout (Task 3 approach)
  ✓ Shared resources across parts
  ✓ Flexibility for product mix changes
  ✓ Lower capital per unit of total output
  ✗ Longer distances for individual parts
  ✗ More complex scheduling

RECOMMENDATION:
  - If P1 is >80% of volume: Use dedicated layout
  - If multiple parts with similar volumes: Use mixed layout
  - Consider cellular manufacturing as compromise

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The comparison reveals a fundamental trade-off:

DEDICATED LAYOUT (Years 2-4):
  ✓ Optimized for single part
  ✓ Minimal distances
  ✓ Lower cost
  ✓ Simpler operations
  ✗ Inflexible
  ✗ Underutilized if demand drops

MIXED LAYOUT (Task 3):
  ✓ Handles all 20 parts
  ✓ Flexible capacity
  ✓ Shared resources
  ✓ Better for product mix
  ✗ Longer distances
  ✗ Higher complexity
  ✗ Larger facility

The choice depends on product strategy, demand stability, and flexibility
requirements. For P1-only production, the dedicated layout is clearly
superior. For mixed production, the shared layout is necessary despite
longer flow distances.
