3. INACTIVE PROCESSES for P1 (faded):
   - E, F, G, H, K, L, M (used by other parts)

4. MATERIAL FLOW ARROWS (red):
   Shows P1's journey: B → A → B → C → D → I → J
   
5. FLOW DETAILS at each transition:
   - Step number
   - Units per week (20,961.54)
   - Distance in feet

START → B (Step 1, 2.5 min) 
        ↓ 43 ft
        A (Step 2, 1.0 min)
        ↓ 43 ft
        B (Step 3, 2.5 min) ← RETURNS TO B
        ↓ 49 ft

        ↓ 55 ft
        D (Step 5, 2.5 min)
        ↓ 413 ft ← LONGEST DISTANCE (goes past E, F, G, H)
        I (Step 6, 1.25 min)
        ↓ 103 ft
        J (Step 7, 2.5 min) → END

================================================================================
KEY DIFFERENCES VS. YEARS 2-4 DEDICATED LAYOUTS
================================================================================

                           TASK 3 Year +1          YEARS 2-4
                           (All Parts)             (P1 Only)
                           ---------------         ----------
Layout Width               1,006 ft                298 ft
Layout Height              252 ft                  108 ft
Total Area                 253,512 sq ft           32,184 sq ft

P1 Total Distance          706 ft/unit             211 ft/unit
P1 Average per Step        117.67 ft               35.17 ft
Longest Single Move        413 ft (D→I)            57 ft (D→I, I→J)

Machines (Total)           344                     72-77
Machines (P1 processes)    173 (shared)            72-77 (dedicated)

Why the difference?
- Task 3 must fit all 20 parts → larger layout
- Processes E, F, G, H between D and I → long distance
- Years 2-4 only need P1 processes → compact layout

================================================================================
WHAT THE VISUALIZATION SHOWS
================================================================================

Look for these key insights in the PNG:

1. SCALE DIFFERENCE:
   - The layout stretches over 1,000 ft horizontally
   - Much larger than Years 2-4 (298 ft)

2. WASTED SPACE for P1:
   - Processes E, F, G, H are faded (not used by P1)
   - But P1 must travel past them (D→I distance = 413 ft)
   - This is the cost of multi-part flexibility

3. PROCESS B USAGE:
   - P1 visits B twice (steps 1 and 3)
   - Arrows show B→A→B path
   - In Years 2-4, this is split into B1 and B2

4. BOTTLENECK PROCESSES:
   - J and M have 49 machines each (largest)
   - D has 45 machines (second largest)
   - These serve many parts, not just P1

5. SHARED RESOURCES:
   - All machines handle multiple parts
   - Example: B's 32 machines serve P1, P3, P4, P5, P6
   - Efficient overall, but longer distances per part

================================================================================
COMPARISON SUMMARY
================================================================================

TASK 3 YEAR +1 (visualized):
  ✓ Handles all 20 parts in one facility
  ✓ Shared machines reduce total equipment needed
  ✓ Flexible for product mix changes
  ✗ P1 travels 706 ft per unit (3.3× longer than dedicated)
  ✗ Large facility (7.9× bigger than dedicated)
  ✗ Complex scheduling across 20 parts

YEARS 2-4 (Task 4 - for comparison):
  ✓ Optimized specifically for P1
  ✓ P1 travels only 211 ft per unit
  ✓ Compact facility (32,184 sq ft)
  ✓ Simple operations (one part only)
  ✗ Cannot handle other parts
  ✗ Inflexible if demand mix changes
  ✗ Each part would need separate facility

================================================================================
WHEN TO USE EACH APPROACH
================================================================================

Use TASK 3 (Multi-Part) Layout if:
  • You produce many different parts (like 20 parts)
  • Product mix changes frequently
  • Parts have similar process requirements
  • Want to share expensive equipment
  • Total volume justifies large facility

Use YEARS 2-4 (Single-Part) Layout if:
  • One part dominates (>80% of volume)
  • Stable demand for specific part
  • Minimizing distance is critical
  • Want simpler operations
  • Dedicated capacity is affordable

VIEWING INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

To see the P1 flow visualization:

1. Open: results/Task3/Part/Jatin/P1_Flow_Visualization_Task3_Year1.png

2. Look for:
   - RED ARROWS showing P1's path
   - HIGHLIGHTED AREAS (B, A, C, D, I, J)
   - FADED AREAS (E, F, G, H, K, L, M - not used by P1)
   - YELLOW BOXES on arrows (showing distance)

3. Compare with Years 2-4 layouts (if available):
   - Much more compact
   - No faded/unused processes
   - All processes aligned sequentially

4. Notice the KEY INSIGHT:
   - D → I arrow is very long (413 ft)
   - This is because E, F, G, H are in between
   - Those processes serve other parts, not P1
   - This is the trade-off for multi-part flexibility

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

If you want to explore further:

1. Compare with Functional Layout:
   - See results/Task3/Functional/ for functional organization
   - Different grouping strategy

2. Compare with Fractal Layout:
   - See results/Task3/Fractal/ for fractal organization
   - Self-similar modular design

3. Run the visualization script:
   cd results/Task3/Part/Jatin
   python visualize_P1_flow.py
   
   → Regenerates the PNG if needed

4. Modify the script:
   - Change colors, labels, or layout
   - Add more detail or annotations
   - Compare multiple scenarios side-by-side

================================================================================
BOTTOM LINE
================================================================================

✅ P1 FLOW VISUALIZATION COMPLETE

The visualization clearly shows why P1 travels 3.3× farther in the Task 3
multi-part layout compared to the dedicated Years 2-4 layouts:

- Task 3 optimizes for ALL 20 parts → larger, more spread out
- Years 2-4 optimize for P1 ONLY → smaller, more compact

Both approaches are valid - choice depends on your production strategy:
- Multiple parts → Use Task 3 approach
- Single part dominates → Use Years 2-4 approach

The visualization makes this trade-off visually obvious!
