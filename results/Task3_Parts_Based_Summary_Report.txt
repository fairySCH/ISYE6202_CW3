TASK 3: PARTS-BASED DESIGN - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

KEY FINDINGS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   • 1-Shift Operation: 763 total equipment units
   • 2-Shift Operation: 386 total equipment units
   • Savings with 2-shift: 377 units (49.4% reduction)

2. BOTTLENECK PROCESSES (Top 5 by Equipment Count):
   • Process J: 55 units, 3843.8 hrs/week
   • Process M: 55 units, 3860.6 hrs/week
   • Process D: 50 units, 3520.8 hrs/week
   • Process B: 36 units, 2491.2 hrs/week
   • Process L: 35 units, 2408.7 hrs/week

3. HIGHEST DEMAND PARTS (Top 5):
   • P1: 20,962 units/week
   • P19: 20,000 units/week
   • P14: 18,077 units/week
   • P20: 14,808 units/week
   • P7: 13,846 units/week

4. UTILIZATION ANALYSIS (2-Shift Operation):
   • Average utilization: 96.0%
   • High utilization (>=95%): 9 processes
   • Low utilization (<90%): 1 processes
   • Low utilization processes:
     - Process K: 87.9%

5. PROCESS FREQUENCY:
   • Total operations per week: 952,500
   • Most frequent processes:
     - Process I: 105,000 ops/week (11.0%)
     - Process J: 98,462 ops/week (10.3%)
     - Process E: 83,462 ops/week (8.8%)

STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS:
================================================================================

1. OPERATION STRATEGY:
   - Recommend 2-SHIFT operation to minimize equipment investment
   - Reduces equipment count by 377 units
   - Maintains high utilization (avg 96.0%)

2. CAPACITY PLANNING:
   - Focus on bottleneck processes: J, M, D, B, L
   - Consider equipment flexibility (multi-process machines)
   - Plan for maintenance windows given high utilization

3. PARTS-BASED DESIGN IMPLICATIONS:
   - Each of 20 parts would have dedicated production cell
   - Cells contain all processes needed for that part
   - Simplifies material flow and reduces WIP
   - May duplicate equipment across cells (consider Group Tech)

4. POTENTIAL PROCESS GROUPINGS (for optimization):
   • A-B-C-D group: High interaction in many parts
   • E-F-G group: Similar equipment requirements
   • H-I-J group: Heavy finishing operations
   • K-L-M group: Lightweight operations
