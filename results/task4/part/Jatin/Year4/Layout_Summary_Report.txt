HIJ Blocks: 14 ft × 36 ft (504 ft² each)
  - No internal sharing
  - Used for I and J process areas

LAYOUT CONFIGURATION
--------------------
Overall Dimensions: 298 ft (W) × 108 ft (H)
Total Footprint: 32,184 ft²
Actual Area Used: 22,176 ft² (equipment footprint)
Space Efficiency: 68.9%

Arrangement: Left-to-right in process order (B1 → A → B2 → C → D → I → J)
Gap Between Areas: 5 ft clear separation
Vertical Alignment: All areas center-aligned for straight horizontal flow

DESIGN FEATURES
---------------
1. Vertical Area Stacking
   - Areas configured as tall/narrow (vertical orientation)
   - Minimizes facility width (298 ft)
   - Maximizes height utilization (108 ft maximum)

2. Center Alignment
   - All areas vertically centered at mid-height
   - Enables straight horizontal material flow arrows
   - Simplifies material handling paths

3. Process Flow Optimization
   - Sequential left-to-right arrangement
   - 5 ft gaps prevent inter-area interference
   - Clear separation between process stages

4. Overlap Visualization
   - 2 ft overlap zones shown in red (ABCD blocks only)
   - Overlaps occur ONLY within same area boundaries
   - No overlaps between different process areas

5. Color Coding
   - B1 & B2: Blue (same family)
   - A: Orange
   - C: Purple
   - D: Cyan
   - I: Green
   - J: Pink

COMPARISON TO YEAR 5 PART 1
----------------------------
Year 4 Part 1 vs Year 5 Part 1:
- Demand: 28,500 vs 29,800 units/week (-4.4%)
- Machines: 77 vs 129 (Year 5 used 1-shift data)
- Layout: 298×108 ft vs 310×110 ft (-4% smaller)
- Footprint: 32,184 ft² vs 34,100 ft² (-5.6%)
- Efficiency: 68.9% vs 98.5% (lower due to different configurations)
- Process Flow: Same (B1→A→B2→C→D→I→J)

Key Similarities:
- Both use ABCD and HIJ block types only
- Same 7 process areas in same sequence
- Both use vertical stacking strategy
- Both center-aligned for straight flow

Key Differences:
- Year 4 has lower demand, needs fewer machines
- Year 4 uses 2-shift data (more realistic)
- Different block configurations to match machine counts

EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS
-------------------
Space Utilization: 68.9%
- Lower than Year 5 (98.5%) due to:
  * More conservative area configurations
  * Smaller machine counts requiring different grid arrangements
  * More white space for flexibility and future expansion

Areas for Potential Improvement:
- Could increase density by optimizing block arrangements
- 5 ft gaps could be reduced to 3 ft if clearance allows
- Alternative vertical configurations may improve packing

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. Layout is well-optimized for Part 1 production flow
2. Consider adding expansion space for future capacity increases
3. Review material handling equipment needs for straight-line flow
4. Validate 5 ft gap requirement with safety and maintenance teams
5. Plan for potential future products that may use same equipment

NOTES
-----
- Layout follows same vertical optimization strategy as Year 5
- All areas use center alignment for straight material flow
- Overlap zones (red) only appear within area boundaries, not between areas
- 2-shift operation assumed (4800 minutes/week per machine)
- Part 1 ONLY - does not include other parts' requirements
